    "title": "FAQ",
    "subtitle": "Frequently asked questions",
    "q1": "What is a highlight video?",
    "a1": "It's a 2-3 minute video featuring the most important scenes from the ceremony, produced in a music video format.",
    "q2": "How long is the documentary-style video?",
    "a2": "We capture everything from the bridal room to the group photos. Since every ceremony is different, the length typically ranges from 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, for the 1P 1Cam documentary video with a single camera, the video may be shorter than stated if the ceremony is very brief.",
    "q3": "What is an SNS video?",
    "a3": "It's a 30-second to 1-minute video in 4K quality with vertical aspect ratio, perfect for Instagram Stories or Reels.",
    "q4": "When will I receive my video?",
    "a4": "We carefully work on each project in order, and delivery is within 3 months from your ceremony date.",
    "q5": "Can I receive the raw footage?",
    "a5": "Since we shoot in 4K, the raw footage exceeds 70GB, making delivery difficult. Additionally, it's recorded in an editing format that isn't easily viewable through standard methods, so we don't provide it by default.\n\nThe documentary-style video already includes the complete ceremony process, so there's typically no need to purchase separately.\n\nIf you wish to have the raw footage for personal editing and uploading to SNS or YouTube, an additional 50,000 KRW fee applies, which covers the conversion process, usage guide, and USB/cloud delivery.",
    "q6": "Can you accommodate my preferred editing style?",
    "a6": "If you share a reference video, we'll do our best to match your preferences. Please note that additional fees may apply depending on the scope of customization.",
    "q7": "When does the videographer arrive at the venue?",
    "a7": "We arrive 1 hour 30 minutes before the ceremony starts. For pre-ceremony shoots, we arrive approximately 2 hours early.\n\nFilming begins 1 hour before the ceremony in the bridal room.\n\n(For pre-ceremony shoots, filming begins 1 hour 30 minutes before.)\n(Pre-ceremony and staged shoots at locations outside the venue and bridal room must be communicated in advance. Without prior notice or if venue conditions don't permit, filming may not be possible.)",
    "q8": "Can I get a receipt?",
    "a8": "Yes, receipts are available for all packages at no additional charge.\n(For contracts from May 1, 2025 onwards)",
    "q9": "Are there travel fees?",
    "a9": "Our main office is located near Seoul, and we recently opened a Cheongju branch. Travel fees apply for cities outside Seoul and Cheongju.\n\nTravel fees for other areas are calculated based on the nearest branch to the venue. If all directors at the nearest branch are fully booked, a director from a farther location may be assigned, which could result in higher travel fees.",
    "q10": "I'd like to add an SNS video to the Standard plan!",
    "a10": "It can be added. Since this is not part of the standard offering, please understand that additional fees may apply.",
    "q11": "When will I receive the final pre-shoot confirmation call?",
    "a11": "We contact you by phone on Monday or Tuesday of your ceremony week. If you don't receive our call, please make sure to reach out via KakaoTalk or phone."
